"""Bambu-style 3MF projects built from a SliceInput (pure; no network).

Shared by the slicer modules that take a Bambu Studio / OrcaSlicer project: BamBuddy
and the sidecar APIs. The parts arrive oriented and dropped onto Z = 0 together
(`orientation.orient_parts`); this module centres them on the bed, lays out copies
(D-25), gives each distinct material its own filament (D-20), pins filaments to
nozzles on dual-nozzle printers, finds prime-tower spots beside the footprint, and
retries a slice with the next spot when the slicer rejects the tower
(`with_tower_retries`), so that logic lives once for every Bambu-style slicer.
